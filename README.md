# Basic Calc- firstrial
\\Just a basic repository that will build overtime to being a main.//

This program is an overly complicated version of a basic calculator. I figured it might help anyone who is looking to use it to practice or improve the calculator.
Its not meant to be the best but give options on how to make your own calculator.
